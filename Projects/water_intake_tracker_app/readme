💧 AI Water Intake Tracker

An end-to-end AI-powered water intake tracking application built to understand how frontend, backend, database, and AI work together in a real-world project.

This project is learning-focused, beginner-friendly, and intentionally designed with clear separation of responsibilities so anyone can understand the full system flow.

🚀 What does this project do?

Lets users log water intake (in ml)

Stores intake data persistently using SQLite

Calculates daily total intake

Shows remaining water based on daily goal

Provides AI-generated motivational feedback

Displays intake history & line graph for easy understanding

Frontend (Streamlit)
        ↓ HTTP Request
Backend API (FastAPI)
        ↓ Function Calls
Database (SQLite)
        ↑ Data
AI Agent (LLM)

🔍 File-by-File Explanation
1️⃣ dashboard.py (Frontend)

Built using Streamlit

Takes user input (user_id, intake_ml)

Sends HTTP requests to backend

Displays:

Success messages

AI feedback

Intake history

Line graph for visualization

👉 No business logic here
Frontend only shows data & sends requests

2️⃣ api.py (Backend API)

Built using FastAPI

Acts as a middleman

Exposes endpoints like:

/log-intake

/history/{user_id}

Calls database functions

Sends structured data to AI agent

👉 Backend = Brain Controller

3️⃣ database.py (Database Layer)

Uses SQLite

Responsible for:

Creating tables

Inserting intake logs

Fetching daily intake history

Calculates total water consumed per day

👉 Database is the source of truth

4️⃣ agent.py (AI Agent)

Uses an LLM

Does NOT calculate numbers

Only generates human-friendly feedback

Receives:

Total intake

Remaining intake

Goal

👉 AI = Communication layer, not logic

5️⃣ logger.py (Logging System)

Uses Python’s built-in logging

Writes logs to app.log

Helps with:

Debugging

Tracking system behavior

Understanding backend flow

👉 Logging = developer’s black box recorder
